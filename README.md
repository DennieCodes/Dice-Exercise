This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Dice Exercise project is one of the first project exercises in Colt Steele's Modern React Bootcamp course on Udemy. The project's purpose is to create a simple React App using class based components that reinforces state concepts.

The master branch will showcase my completed Class based version of the project.

There will also be another branch where the project is re-factored using Hooks.
